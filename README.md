# Coding MWE 

To present a minimal working example I thought it would make sense to present two distinct projects I have done in the past. One of them a project in Urban Data Science in Python (version 3.8.4) and other a Case Study about differential expression of a Cancer Dataset in R (version ).

## Project in _Urban_ Data Science

As one of the coding MWE, I decided to present a previous project that I did for one of the courses I completed in the Delft University of Technology, Introduction to _Urban_ Data Science, where I chose to step out of my confort zone and deal with non-biological data.

The project aimed to formulate and test an hypothesis about an Urban area. I hypothesized that the neighbourhoods of The Hague, The Netherlands, with **higher average incomes** are more prone to **emit $CO_2$**. Later, I also analysed if the bike lane length per neighbourhood could be related to it, hypotesizing that a bigger amount of **bike lanes** available could translate in a minor use of transportation by motorized vehicles and therefore a minor $CO_2$ emission, being 2016 the base year for my analysis.

### Data

The data used for this project was extracted from [Den Haag in Cijfers](https://denhaag.incijfers.nl/jive) and made available by the docent team, in particular a shapefile of The Hague's neighbourhoods (under the data folder in this repository).
